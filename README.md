In this project , I have done data analysis on a dataset named 'application-data.csv' downloaded from Kaggle , which contains data about people who want to take a loan .
The dataset contains columns such as Income , Annuity , Job Status etc . After doing data analysis and some feature engineering , I trained an SVM classifier upon the data , to classify a new person who wants to take a loan as a fraud or a genuine person . Lastly I developed a system , wherein the system would ask you to enter your username and password , upon successful authentication , the system generates an OTP , which is used to further authenticate the user , after which the SVM classifier identifies the loan requester as fraudulent or  genuine
